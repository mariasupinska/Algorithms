# Algorithms

A collection of various algorithms written during the course of Algorithms and Data Structures.
Each algorithm has the full content of the coded task attached.

### BST
The program consisting of two parts (A and B) that uses skillful implementation and use of a Binary Search Tree.

Part A: Implements and tests the ability to perform operations on the tree.

Part B: Implements a Polish-English dictionary consisting of two BSTs (Polish BST and English BST), in which each node from one tree is linked with the corresponding node from the other tree. The program has the ability to perform tasks such as:
* writing out English (Polish) words with translations in the KLP order (to a file),
* finding a Polish (English) word with a translation,
* adding a new word with translation,
* removing a word with its translation.

### Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
The program implements a greedy algorithm for maximum flow problem. In the task a network is given with a distinguished source *s* and an outlet *t*, on the basis of which the maximum flow in the network is determined.

### 0-1 Knapsack Problem
The program is a dynamic programming solution for the knapsack problem. In order to be efficient a table to store previous compitations is used.

### Kruskal's Algorithm
The program implements a greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) which connects together all the vertices of a connected and undirected graph.
